# Python for Data Science Series

This repo contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks to help you learn the basics of the Python programm\
ing language together with some of the packages that are used frequently in data science. Although we pr\
ovide some concrete examples of machine learning techniques, such as decision trees and regression, thes\
e exercises are intended to illustrate syntax and mechanics rather than the specific methods.

## Getting started

**Python basics.ipynb**

If you're new to Python, we recommend that you start here. This notebook covers the fundamentals of the \
language: basic math, Boolean and logical operations, comments, strings, lists, dictionaries, sets, tupl\
es, branches and conditionals, loops, functions, modules, obtaining information about objects and the Py\
thon help capabilities. In fact, even if you already know Python and could use a refresher or you're new\
 to Jupyter notebooks, this is still a good place to start.
 
## Packages 

## Useful material to cover at any time

Although the following resources are not specific to Python, they will be useful as you create your own \
notebooks. This material can be covered at any time and may serve as an *intermission* after working thr\
ough some of the more challenging material.

**Markdown.ipynb**

Covers the basics of markdown language: headers, italics and emphasis, new lines and paragraphs, special\
 characters and formating code examples. Markdown is deliberately simple and this notebook should only t\
ake a few minutes to read.

**LaTeX math.ipynb**

Introduces the basics of formatting math using LaTeX. Can be used both in the markdown cells of Jupyter notebooks and the figure elements (e.g. titles, axis labels, legends) of plotting packages such as Matplotlib.

**strings.ipynb**

Introduces a few more string handling features, including how to access useful string constants (so, for example, you don't have to keep typing 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' every time you need a list of lowercase letters).
