# Python for Data Science Series

This repo contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks to help you learn the basics of the Python programming language together with some of the packages that are used frequently in data science. Although we provide some concrete examples of machine learning techniques, such as decision trees and regression, these exercises are intended to illustrate syntax and mechanics rather than the specific methods.

## Getting started

**Python basics.ipynb**

If you're new to Python, we recommend that you start here. This notebook covers the fundamentals of the language: basic math, Boolean and logical operations, comments, strings, lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, branches and conditionals, loops, functions, modules, obtaining information about objects and the Python help capabilities. In fact, even if you already know Python and could use a refresher or you're new to Jupyter notebooks, this is still a good place to start.

## Useful material to cover at any time

Although the following resources are not specific to Python, they will be useful as you create your own notebooks. This material can be covered at any time and may serve as an *intermission* after working through some of the more challenging material.

**Markdown.ipynb**

Covers the basics of markdown language: headers, italics and emphasis, new lines and paragraphs, special characters and formating code examples. Markdown is deliberately simple and this notebook should only take a few minutes to read.

**LaTeX ipython.ipynb**

Introduces the basics of LaTeX
